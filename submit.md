# Submit/Contact | The Groovy Galleon

**Navigation:** [Home](index) \| [About](about) \| [Track Archive](tunes) \| [Submit/Contact](submit) \| [Podcast](podcast) \|

All submissions should go to "mark silver media at proton mail dot com". Here are a few Groovy Galleon-related things you can submit to that email address:

## Submit your tunes to the archive

Do you make music? Is it groovy? Is it freely licensed? If you answered yes to all of these questions, then consider submitting your tunes to the Groovy Galleon track archive. Seriously, show me what you've got; I always love getting a taste of something new. Are you interested? Here's a few more things to consider before emailing me with your tune:

- Whatever track you submit needs to be freely licensed, meaning that people can listen to, download, & share the track as they please. When sending me your track, I need you to express to me directly what license you are using so I can properly attribute it on this website. Licenses that are totally cool include but aren't limited to GPLv2, CC BY 4.0, & public domain. I especially like CC BY 4.0, but that's just me. ;)
- Any audio format is fine, but I especially prefer mp3, ogg, & flac, because they're all libre formats. If you send me a video, I'll convert it to flac, simply because videos would make this site a bit messy.
- I'll manually read through every submission I receive, and try to get back to you within a day about whether it will appear on the track archive.
- Please submit your own work. Even if another artist licenses their music in a way where it could appear on this website, I'd still rather it be a decision that they make, not you. Sorry. :P
- I want to make this process as fair as possible, but at the same time, I'm a human being with personal tastes, upon which I reserve the right to reject a submitted track. If your track isn't accepted into the archive, I will inform you of exactly my reasoning for doing so.

## Podcast Interview?

If you are a musician/band & would like for me to interview you on the podcast, please email me with "Podcast Interview" in the subject line & a sample of your music in the message body, & I'll get back to you as soon as possible.

## Submit music for me to review

I'm not the guru of finding hip alternative tunes to review for the Groovy Galleon Podcast. As a matter of personal preference, I go out of my way to find new music, but I can't find everything. If you've heard an album from an artist/band that I'm probably not aware of, shoot me an email & I'd totally be willing to check them out. Some of my favorite tunes are ones that I've came across by complete accident or ones that friends have asked me to check out, so suggestions are totally welcome. Here's a few more things to consider:

- I'm primarily looking for albums (EPs/LPs) as opposed to singles. That's not to say I won't review a single, but I'm more of an album kind of guy. As a general rule with albums, I'd most prefer to check out something in the ballpark of 10-15 tracks, but I won't refuse to check out something that doesn't meet that criteria (heck, the number of tracks in releases I've reviewed ranges from 4 to 30).
- I don't care as much about licensing for reviewing purposes, because fair use protects me where the license doesn't. Despite that, I likely won't play a clip of a song that isn't freely licensed on the show, simply because I want to prioritize showcasing libre audio.
- If I don't review your request in the week of you having submitted it to me, don't fret. As a certified human being, it takes time for me to process what I've listened to & cobble together my thoughts on said tunes. If I intend to reject your suggestion, I will email you directly saying so with my reasoning for why.
